[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

> CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)  
>> -0.088672927072602 
>
> being a first has a stronger effect on weight then on length. length has a positive correlation and weight has a negative correlation
