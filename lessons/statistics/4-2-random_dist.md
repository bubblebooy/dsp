[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

```python
rnd1000 = np.random.random(1000)
```

```python
thinkplot.Pmfs([thinkstats2.Pmf(rnd1000)])
```

```python
thinkplot.Cdfs([thinkstats2.Cdf(rnd1000)])
```

The distribution is uniform
